# Pokedex Compose

Pokedex Compose is an independent re-write of a similar project by the name
of [Pokedex](https://github.com/skydoves/Pokedex). I am recreating the UI but I am doing it
using Google's new UI framework Jetpack Compose. I am leveraging the MVVM architecture along with
Hilt for dependency injection and Retrofit for making API calls. The full list of libraries will be
updated at a later time.
