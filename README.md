# Pokedex Compose

Pokedex Compose is an independent re-write of a similar project by the name
of [Pokedex](https://github.com/skydoves/Pokedex). I am recreating the UI but I am doing it using
Google's new UI framework Jetpack Compose and also adding additional functionalities like a favorite
pokemon list and a pokemon search. I am leveraging the MVVM architecture along with Hilt for
dependency injection and Retrofit for making API calls. Full library list below.

    - Paging3 - Android library that makkes it easier to load data gradually and gracefully.
- Architecture
    - MVVM Architecture (Model - View - ViewModel)
    - Repository pattern

- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi/) - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [Landscapist](https://github.com/skydoves/Landscapist) - Jetpack Compose image loading library which can fetch and display network images using Glide, Coil, Fresco.
- [Accompanist](https://github.com/google/accompanist) - A group of libraries that aim to supplement Jetpack Compose with features that are commonly required by developers but not yet available.
- [Material-Icons](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/icons/Icons) - Material design icons for your app.
