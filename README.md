# Pokedex Compose

Pokedex Compose is an independent re-write of a similar project by the name
of [Pokedex](https://github.com/skydoves/Pokedex). I am recreating the UI but I am doing it using
Google's new UI framework Jetpack Compose and also adding additional funtionalities like a favorite
pokemon list and a pokemon search. I am leveraging the MVVM architecture along with Hilt for
dependency injection and Retrofit for making API calls.
